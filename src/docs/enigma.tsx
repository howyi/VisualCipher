        This page uses{' '}
        <a href="https://howyi.github.io/visualcipher/">VisualCipher</a> to
        digitally visualize and reproduce a 3-rotor model of Enigma, the famous
        cryptographic machine used by Nazi Germany during World War II.
        <br />
        The Enigma is known for its unique structure and complex encryption
        process, and through this emulator, users can actually experience the
        behavior of the plugboard, scrambler, and reflector.

        Input must be provided in string format with a space per character (e.g.
        [AB CD] will convert A to B and B to A).

      <h3 id="scramblers-and-reflectors">Scramblers and Reflectors</h3>
      <p>
        Real scramblers and reflectors are available through the template
        selection. It is also possible to implement original scramblers (and
        reflectors) by writing directly in the wiring field.
      </p>
      <h2 id="how-it-works-">How it works:</h2>
      <p>
        The Enigma Entry Wheel is connected to the rightmost Scrambler and
        rotates with each input. The non-rightmost Scrambler rotates only when
        the Scrambler to its own right passes the Notch.
